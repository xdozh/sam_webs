"1 year? 52 weeks? 365 days? 8,760 hours? 31, 536, 000 seconds? Wow even writing this is making me very emotional. We did it my babey! I've been trying so hard for weeks to know how I can start this off right but I realised that the best thing is to speak from my heart. I'mso proud of us and how far we've come, I can literally remember the first time we met like it was yesterday and I mean it, from every single passing moment, to me being nervous the longer I had to wait for my princess, to the first time I got a glimpse of your beauty, to me contemplating whether its right to hold your hand on the way down from the stairs or not, to how beautifully you dressed, to how you made me feel a feeling l've never felt before, to how calm you made my soul on that night. There was many many beautiful things about that night that I will never forget, but most important of all is how sure you made me feel that you are the woman I wanna spend the rest of my life with. My most beautiful princess, my sweetest angel, my Babygirl, my best friend, my twin, my literal everything. Oh how my heart falls into so much joy when i see that beautiful precious smile of yours, being able to keep that smile on your face is one of my biggest missions. It‚Äôs a blessing to go through life with you my heart, I realised how beautiful love is, even more so now that I found ‚ÄúHER‚Äù. Thank you honestly for everything my soul, it hasn‚Äôt been easy, it hasn‚Äôt been a simple path, but it‚Äôs been such a beautiful one, you‚Äôve allowed me to realise what love truly is and the most beautiful part is constantly choosing you every single day no matter the circumstances. We‚Äôve grown and come such a long way, it‚Äôs actually crazy I can say so much but I feel like we‚Äôd be reading this all night. When I say this, I say this whole heartedly, you my princess have made me such a better man, there‚Äôs still so much to change and so much to do but I see the man I‚Äôm becoming and you are a huge part of that. Just the thought of you alone pushes me in times where I‚Äôm feeling tired. I can‚Äôt wait to be the man to give you everything you want, because you my baby deserve the WORLD. I look forward to the future and I get so so excited, because every day is a step closer to us being together everyday, unlimited sleepovers üòÇ, waking up to see your beautiful face in the morning Ughhhh, I can‚Äôt wait. The way how times flying it might not be that long until that happens my princess. I bless the Lord that he gave me such a wonderful loving caring beautiful woman like you, he gave me YOU. As we go in to our future together my lover, I want this to be a turning point where we put our Lord and Saviour as the center of our life and relationship, we love the Lord but we can give him much more of ourselves and I want us to make sure that happens. Once again my princess I wanna thank you for stepping in to my life, because with you it has been so much more meaningful and I have more reason, I know I say this often but when I do I mean it, you brought the colour into my world my lover, you are my safety. Thank you for being yourself and that‚Äôs all I ever wanted. Our next chapter? Brings so much joy excitement and laughter to even think about it my heart, ughh im so thankful for you it‚Äôs insane. I love you with every single breath that I take. Song of Solomon 3:4 (ESV) ‚ÄúI have found the one whom my soul loves. Happy 1 year anniversary my life, To us forever, my future wife‚ù§Ô∏è",

My heart is heavy because im not able to be by your side lighting up our 9th candle.This summer hasn't been easy it has been far from that, the thought that I can't just up and go to see you is hurting me deeply, but there's a lot of growth that we went through that made us stronger than when we started the summer. you are continually helping me see where I can improve and be better and being my rock and my safest place. The next time I celebrate this special day with you, I'll be with you. That fact alone brings so much joy to my heart.

"My baby, my lover, my most beautiful beautiful girl wow just wow, 8 months has never felt so fast. This time away has really taught me alot about us, alot honestly. We've come such a long way honestly, but l'm so happy at the same time that it's flying because it's another day closer to seeing my baby again You are my angel and when I say it you should genuinely understand what I mean, you've not only been the biggest blessing to me but you're helping me shape myself into the man that God has called me to be and I know that I will because I have you by my side. I cannot wait honestly l'm so excited for our future because all I see is a bright beautiful lovely future filled with love joy peace and happiness, I'm cheesing and getting all emotional while writing this because I'm really seeing the difference that you bring in my life, you're my colour in this world of darkness, but who cares about the world anyway at the end of the day my world is you . I love how this time away has helped us to understand each other better aswell ik that this will be a great foundation for the years to come (basically forever). Oh how I miss you so very much; how I miss you so very much, how I miss your touch, your cute laugh, seeing the joy in your eyes, your presence, just your presence is more than enough for me. I remember how beautifully we started off our year, and we know the devils fighting so hard for us to slip away but we realised it all and now we're going to continue and finish off the year in the best way my heart, together, I thank my heavenly father because he blessed me with his angel for me.

My precious lover, my beautiful princess, my cute baby, time is flying but atleast it's flying with you by my side my princess, and i couldn't be more happy that that's the case. You've completely turned my world upside down, you're my whole world and forever be that way. In these past months, we have grown so so so much as individuals and together. I love to see you grow in to the loving beautiful intelligent amazing woman that God has created you to be and to understand the mission he has for you and our lives. I can't explain how immensely proud of you l am in every single way. You are so strong! Very strong and I'm realising that more and more every day.

"it's been 4 months since the day you became mine, oh how time flies! My baby you have made me the luckiest and happiest man there is because of your presence in my life let alone all the things that you have done to change me and love me in the best way possible. I've learnt alot in this time that l've know you and I know that this is just the beginning to something absolutely beautiful. The more I understand who you are and everything about you the more my love grows for you each day that goes by. I really wish that I could be with you everyday but I guess that's just something we'll have to be patient for. Nothing matters when I'm with you, it's as if my mind completely quiets down completely when I'm with you which is a feeling l've never felt in my life, you presence alone makes me feel that way and there's so many other things the way how you look so very beautiful when you're emotional with me and how you're eyes shine brighter than the stars and how radiant your personality is you're literally a bundle of joy and sweetness and how pure and gentle your soul is and how your body is perfect to the tea! i have both my bestfriend and lover in one person am i not the luckiest guy in the world? my absolute favourite soul ever, blessed to know that we're interlinked because l'd have it no other way, i love you so very much my everything to forever together.",

"My heart, my love, my baby, my everything, who would've thought at the beginning of this year that you would be my lover? you've changed my whole life around, now we end 2024 with so much to look ahead into 2025. I cant be more grateful to have you in my life, I thank God everyday for you and I know i say it all the time but I mean it with all my heart every. single. time. you are my answered prayer. Another year ahead and what better way to start it with the love of my life by my side, you've taught me a lot and helped me get through more than you know. I cannot begin to express the love I have for you, it is endless and you deserve the ABSOLUTE WORLD, and I truly mean it. you have such a beautiful, amazing, caring, loving, joyful soul and there is literally and I mean literally NO ONE like you in this world. I Love you so so much, I love you with all my heart, it hurts that we can't be together to share this moment, I miss you every single moment that passes by but I gotta get through this , Can't wait for the year ahead that we share together, I know with God by our side we will be able to be our best in this year. I love you my baby, my moving heartü´∂‚ù§Ô∏è",
"My baby, you know words can never fully describe how much I love you. there's so so many reasons why I love you, and I thank God that he blessed me with someone like you, you've shown what it truly means to love and how to walk in it. from how you care about me to how you make me feel like I can be myself around you which is something I don't take lightly at all, to you're effort in expressing yourself, to how just even your presence is so warming to me, your beautiful smile brightens up my day, hearing your laugh brings so much warmth to my heart, you have such a loving beautiful amazing soul. I can't stress enough how blessed I am to have someone like you, it's funny when you say you think we're not compatible, because how I see it, you're the type of woman l've always wanted in my life, just because we might not see eye to eye at times, is not a sign of that. we still never give up on each other in the times where we might feel like it's the toughest time. I love you, so so so much, with all of my being and with all my heart. nothing and I mean nothing will ever change that. there's so much more let alone how much I miss you every single day that passes by. I love youü´Ç‚ù§Ô∏è",
